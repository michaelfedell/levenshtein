# Levenshtein Distance

The Levenshtein Distance is a metric used to compare the similarity of two strings.

In short, the metric represents the number of operations required to change one string to another where each operation entails inserting, deleting, or replacing a character. Although cost of replacement varies across implementations, this particular version will count character-replacement as two operations.

The Levenshtein Distance is often used to find a string that is most similar to a target string. Common use cases include spelling corrections and type suggestions. Though powerful, this metric is most useful in concert with other logic to select alternate words.

## Implementations

I have chosen to implement this metric programatically to better understand the underlying algorithm as well as to practice algorithm implementation and optimization in various language

This algorithm will be implemented in the following languages:

- ~~python~~
- **R**
- **C**
- **Java**
- **JavaScript**
